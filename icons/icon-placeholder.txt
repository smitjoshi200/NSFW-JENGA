To complete the PWA setup, you'll need to create icon PNG files in the following sizes:

1. icon-72x72.png
2. icon-96x96.png
3. icon-128x128.png
4. icon-144x144.png
5. icon-152x152.png
6. icon-192x192.png
7. icon-384x384.png
8. icon-512x512.png

You can use the logo.svg file created in this project and convert it to these PNG formats using:

1. Online SVG to PNG converters
2. Image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or Inkscape
3. If you have Inkscape installed, you can use the provided generate-icons.sh script

Place all PNG files in this 'icons' directory.

For the best experience, generate all icon sizes to ensure compatibility with various devices and platforms.
