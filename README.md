## Development

### Files and Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML structure
- `styles.css` - Styling for the app
- `script.js` - Core game functionality
- `pwa.js` - PWA-specific functionality
- `service-worker.js` - Offline caching and PWA behavior
- `manifest.json` - PWA installation configuration
- `logo.svg` - Vector logo
- `icons/` - App icons in various sizes

### Icon Generation

To generate the required icons from the SVG logo, use:

```bash
# If Inkscape is installed:
./generate-icons.sh

# Otherwise, use an online converter to create the following icons:
# icon-72x72.png, icon-96x96.png, icon-128x128.png, icon-144x144.png,
# icon-152x152.png, icon-192x192.png, icon-384x384.png, icon-512x512.png
```

## How It Works

### Challenge Sharing

Challenges are shared through URL parameters:

1. The app encodes your challenge list using Base64 encoding
2. It creates a shareable URL with the encoded data as a parameter
3. When someone opens the URL, the app detects and decodes the parameter
4. The recipient is prompted to import the challenges

This approach allows sharing without requiring a server or database, keeping all data local to the user's device.
